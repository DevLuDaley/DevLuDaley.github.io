** Pay it forward: Thoughts about the fis programming course and coding in general.**

#### 1 - Attention to detail. 
Initially syntax seems daunting but after a while it become second nature. Still, you can expedite this learning curve by writing (and reading) as much code as you can.  

#### 2 - A working computer does exactly what it is told to do.
That's means the problem/error is your fault, and that's okay, for now. 
Get used not knowing and get good at finding answers. 

#### 3 -  It's all about instructions.
Programming is about how well you can read, write, and articulate efficient instructions. 


#### 4 - use aaq. they're very helpful.
If possible, write down a list of what you've already tried. this will help you and whoever is trying to help you. aaq or not. 

Get practice explaining issues/errors and/or what you don't understand.
		 
#### 5 - if you're slef-paced...
Have a schedule and have a buddy that you can check in with evey once in a while. 

#### 6 - if you're in a cohort...
Make use of your class labs and instructor. 
Keep a list of questions to ask.
Ask for help in finding answers. the goal is to be succesful at finding information and understanding documentation.

#### 7- Documentation.

Stop thinking of documentation as a stuffy old manual. 
Start a small side project with small goals. 
Think of and use the documentation as a guide to a all the cool things you can do with your new gadget/toy.

#### 8 - Programing is about input and output. 
Our bodies are no different. 
Set a bedtime, eat the best that you can and take care of yourself.

#### 9 - Project reviews aren't tests. 

They're an opportunity to show of your work and see how well you know your stuff. 
You don't have to have that section memorized. 

You need to understand how and why to make decisions in your code. Spend time talking about your project with a friend and vice versa. 
The more you talk about your project the better you'll understand where you need to improve.

#### 10 - Programming is rewarding.
We're fortunate to be able to program. If you can, help others.
