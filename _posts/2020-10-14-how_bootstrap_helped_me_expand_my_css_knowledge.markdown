One of my goals for my rails-api/javascript frontend project was to try something new. 
In my previous projects I did very minimal styling outside of the basic bootstrap templates. This time, since it would be my first single page applicatio,  I wanted more control over my page layout. With bootstrap handling the ui I was free to focus on the data, but in some ways I was also limited. I decided that while designing my ui, I would also dedicate time to studing and improving my css and html. I knew I was no css guru so I thought styudying would be best. 

First, I started off building a table at the center of my app. I created a color scheme for my columns rows and buttons and was about to create a banner. But as I continued I realized that I didn't like what I was creating. The app felt uninviting and boring. The time that I invested in learning more html and css hepled me decide how to redisign my app. That was the difference. Since I invested time in learning more ahead of time I was far more comfotable trying something new. I was excited, I'd learned a few things and answered some longstanding questions so I was ready to design. 

I knew I wanted better structure. So I went back to the basics. I went back to when I first learned html and css.
I read articles and did some beginner execises. Soon enough I realized that I was using div tags incorrectly in my html. I used css documentation and resources to confirm that I was using best practices. 
I'd always used div tags as containers but I found that section tags are a better container since divs are best for styling. When I first learned html I used divs, spans, articles, etc, but I soon fell into a habit of using a div for just about eveything. I'm happy that I've broken out of that habit.

I redesigned my html sctructure and the rest of the app starting falling in place. By relying exclusively on bootstrap I was limiting my own growth as a designer. I'm not anti-bootstrap at all, I'll probably use it in the future but I'm happy that I took the step away to focus on the basics and best practices behind web technologies. Now I have abetter understanding of what bootstrap was doing for me. I think startting with a css framework is fine but I would definitely suggest eventually building a custom design. It was an amazing experience and I appreciate my project more than ever before.
